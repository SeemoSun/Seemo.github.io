## Welcome to Ximo Sun's Pages

I am an senior undergraduate in Physics Department. 

My research interests include, Atomic Physics, Quantum Optics, Ion trap Quantum Computation. Specific works are mentioned in details below at the Reseach Experience Part.

I use [Reading Notes](https://seemosun.github.io/readingnotes.github.io/) pages to update the my paper scientific reading notes, feel free to contact my by [emails](sxm18@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn) if you have any questions.


Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Eduacation Background and Academic Perfomance

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/SeemoSun/Seemo.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
